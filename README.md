<h1> William and Gilbert the AI </h1>

<p> Will and Gill are two of the same "chatterbot" AI just communicating to each other. I've just been using them to test what I can do with Chatter and reaserch how AI works. Chatterbot has a few included dictionaries and trained sets that are used in my work. Both bots are trained with the English, French, German, and Spanish corpuses and are presented a question to start their conversation with. </p>

<h2> My Results </h2>
<p>I've noticed that computers, even ones running AI are not random. The limited training of these bots has proven that computers have no ability to be random. The output from the bots will always loop at some point or another no matter what question is. Below is a link to the output from pycharm. </p>

<p> Will and Gill aren't packaged due to an incompatibility between pyinstaller, chatterbot, and broken dependancies that need manual fixing.</p>
